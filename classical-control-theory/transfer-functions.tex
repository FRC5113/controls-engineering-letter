\chapter{Transfer functions}

This chapter is intended to provide a framework within which to understand
results from the mathematical machinery of modern control as well as vocabulary
to communicate that understanding. We will briefly discuss what transfer
functions are, how the locations of poles and zeroes affect
\gls{system response} and stability, and how controllers affect pole locations.
