\chapter{Transfer functions}

This chapter briefly discusses what transfer functions are, how the locations of
poles and zeroes affect \gls{system response} and stability, and how controllers
affect pole locations. We won't use transfer functions in modern control theory,
but this chapter will provide a framework within which to understand results
from the mathematical machinery of modern control as well as vocabulary with
which to communicate that understanding.
