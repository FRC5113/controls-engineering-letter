\chapter{Transfer functions}

This chapter briefly discusses what transfer functions are, how the locations of
poles and zeroes affect \gls{system response} and stability, and how controllers
affect pole locations. As long as you understand those concepts, don't worry too
much about not being able to follow the math presented here; we won't use
transfer functions in modern control theory (it's mainly provided for
completeness). This chapter is intended to provide a framework within which to
understand results from the mathematical machinery of modern control as well as
vocabulary with which to communicate that understanding.
