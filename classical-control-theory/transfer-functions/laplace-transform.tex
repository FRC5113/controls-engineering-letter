\section{Laplace transform}

For an introduction to Laplace transforms and the geometric intuition behind
transfer functions, we recommend watching Zach Star's video ``What does the
Laplace Transform really tell us? A visual explanation (plus applications)" (21
minutes) \cite{bib:laplace_transform}. A more mathematical introduction is
presented later in chapter \ref{ch:laplace-domain-analysis}.
