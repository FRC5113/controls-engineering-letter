\chapter{PID controllers}
\index{PID control}

The PID controller is a commonly used feedback controller consisting of
proportional, integral, and derivative terms, hence the name. This chapter will
build up the definition of a PID controller term by term while trying to provide
intuition for how each of them behaves.

For those already familiar with PID control, this book's interpretation won't be
consistent with the classical intuition of "past", "present", and "future"
error. We will be approaching it from the viewpoint of modern control theory
with proportional controllers applied to different physical quantities we care
about. This will provide a more complete explanation of the derivative term's
behavior for constant and moving \glspl{setpoint}, and this intuition will carry
over to the modern control methods covered later in this book.

For PID controllers, the \gls{reference} is called the \gls{setpoint} (the
desired position) and the \gls{output} is called the \gls{process variable} (the
measured position). Below are some common variable naming conventions for
relevant quantities.

\begin{figurekey}
  \begin{tabular}{llll}
    $r(t)$ & \gls{setpoint} & $u(t)$ & \gls{control input} \\
    $e(t)$ & \gls{error} & $y(t)$ & \gls{output}
  \end{tabular}
\end{figurekey}

The \gls{error} $e(t)$ is $r(t) - y(t)$.
