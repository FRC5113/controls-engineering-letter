\section{From PID control to model-based control}
\index{PID control}

As mentioned before, controls engineers have a more general framework to
describe control theory than just PID control. PID controller designers are
focused on fiddling with controller parameters relating to the current, past,
and future \gls{error} rather than the underlying system \glspl{state}. Integral
control is a commonly used tool, and some people use integral action as the
majority of the control action. While this approach works in a lot of
situations, it is an incomplete view of the world.

Model-based control has a completely different mindset. Controls designers using
model-based control care about developing an accurate \gls{model} of the
\gls{system}, then driving the \glspl{state} they care about to zero (or to a
\gls{reference}). Integral control is added with $u_{error}$ estimation if
needed to handle \gls{model} uncertainty, but we prefer not to use it because
its response is hard to tune and some of its destabilizing dynamics aren't
visible during simulation.
