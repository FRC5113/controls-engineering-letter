\section{Phase loss}

However, \gls{discretization} has drawbacks. Since a microcontroller performs
discrete steps, there is a sample delay that introduces phase loss in the
controller. Phase loss is the reduction of \gls{phase margin}\footnote{See
section \ref{sec:gain_phase_margin} for an explanation of phase margin.} that
occurs in digital implementations of feedback controllers from sampling the
continuous \gls{system} at discrete time intervals. As the sample rate of the
controller decreases, the \gls{phase margin} decreases according to
$-\frac{T}{2}\omega$ where $T$ is the sample period and $\omega$ is the
frequency of the \gls{system} dynamics. Instability occurs if the
\gls{phase margin} of the \gls{system} reaches zero. Large amounts of phase loss
can make a stable controller in the continuous domain become unstable in the
discrete domain. Here are a few ways to combat this.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Run the controller with a high sample rate.
  \item Designing the controller in the analog domain with enough
    \gls{phase margin} to compensate for any phase loss that occurs as part of
    \gls{discretization}.
  \item Convert the \gls{plant} to the digital domain and design the controller
    completely in the digital domain.
\end{itemize}
