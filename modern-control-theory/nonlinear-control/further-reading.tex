\section{Further reading}

To learn more about nonlinear control, we recommend watching the underactuated
robotics lectures by MIT \cite{bib:underactuated_videos}. Links to it and the
associated lecture note \cite{bib:underactuated_book} are in the bibliography.
The books \textit{Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos} by Steven Strogatz and
\textit{Applied Nonlinear Control} by Jean-Jacques Slotine are also good
references.
