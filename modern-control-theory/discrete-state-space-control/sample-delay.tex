\section{Sample delay}

Implementing a discrete control system is easier than implementing a continuous
one, but \gls{discretization} has drawbacks. A microcontroller updates the
system input in discrete intervals of duration $T$; it's held constant between
updates. This introduces an average sample delay of $\frac{T}{2}$. Large delays
can make a stable controller in the continuous domain become unstable in the
discrete domain. Here are a few ways to combat this.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Run the controller with a high sample rate.
  \item Designing the controller in the analog domain with enough
    \gls{phase margin} to compensate for any phase loss that occurs as part of
    \gls{discretization}.
  \item Convert the \gls{plant} to the digital domain and design the controller
    completely in the digital domain.
\end{itemize}
