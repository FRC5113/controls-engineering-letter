\section{Eigenvalues and stability}

\index{stability!poles}
The eigenvalues of $\mtx{A}$ are called \textit{poles}. The locations of the
closed-loop poles in the complex plane determine the stability of the
\gls{system}. Each pole represents a frequency mode of the \gls{system}, and
their location determines how much of each response is induced for a given input
frequency. Figure \ref{fig:impulse_response_eig} shows the \glspl{impulse
response} in the time domain for \glspl{system} with various pole locations.
They all have an initial condition of $1$.

When a \gls{system} is stable, its output may oscillate but it converges to
steady-state. When a \gls{system} is marginally stable, its output oscillates at
a constant amplitude forever. When a \gls{system} is unstable, its output grows
without bound.
\begin{remark}
  Imaginary poles always come in complex conjugate pairs (e.g., $-2 + 3i$,
  $-2 - 3i$).
