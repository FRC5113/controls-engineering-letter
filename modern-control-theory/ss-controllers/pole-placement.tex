\section{Pole placement}
\index{controller design!pole placement}

This is the practice of placing the poles of a closed-loop \gls{system} directly
to produce a desired response. Python Control offers several pole placement
algorithms for generating controller or observer gains from a set of poles. In
general, pole placement should only be used if you know what you're doing. It's
much easier to let LQR place the poles for you, which we'll discuss next.
