## Teach topics more thoroughly

The book is still somewhat dense and fast-paced (it covers three classes of
feedback control, two of which are for graduate students, in one short book).
More examples of concepts should help slow the pace down. I should read through
this book as if I was explaining it to my veteran software students and
anticipate gaps in their understanding.

### All chapters

* Fix book glossary (less self-referential?) and define terms on first use
  * Box at beginning of each chapter with terms?
* Redefine variables used at start of each chapter, or when saying "using this
  thing from a previous section".
* Add summary page to each chapter with relevant equations.
* Add executive summaries of each chapter to facilitate tl;drs similar to what
  has been said in 1-on-1 discussions online when students don't understand.
* Decompress walls of math. The Kalman filter derivation is a particularly big
  offender.
* Reintroduce variables in later chapters that came from earlier chapters to
  avoid confusion and needing to trace a tree of references.
* Add exercises at the end of each chapter (with solutions) for reader practice.
  This book is supposed to be "practical" after all.
  * This should help me see the points I want to teach in each chapter (since
    the students should be able to complete the problems) so I can make sure the
    chapter teaches it sufficiently.
  * Basically like implicit learning outcomes?
