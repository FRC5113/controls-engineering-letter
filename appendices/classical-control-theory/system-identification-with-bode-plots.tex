\section{System identification with Bode plots}

It's straightforward to perform system identification by feeding a system sine
waves of increasing frequency, recording the amplitude of the output
oscillations, then collating that information into a Bode plot. This plot can be
used to create a transfer function, or lead and lag compensators can be applied
directly based on the Bode plot.
