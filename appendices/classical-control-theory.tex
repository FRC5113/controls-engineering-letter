\chapter{Classical control theory}

This appendix is provided for those who are curious about a lower-level
interpretation of control systems. It describes what a transfer function is and
shows how they can be used to analyze dynamical systems. Emphasis is placed on
the geometric intuition of this analysis rather than the frequency domain math.
Many tools exclusive to classical control theory (root locus, Bode plots,
Nyquist plots, etc.) aren't useful for or relevant to the examples presented in
the main chapters, so they would serve only to complicate the learning process.

Classical control theory is interesting in that one can perform stability and
robustness analyses and design reasonable controllers for systems on the back of
a napkin. It's also useful for controlling systems which don't have a model. One
can generate a Bode plot of a system by feeding in sine waves of increasing
frequency and recording the amplitude of the output oscillations. This data can
be used to create a transfer function or lead and lag compensators can be
applied directly based on the Bode plot. However, computing power is much more
plentiful nowadays; we should take advantage of this in the design phase and use
the more modern tools that enables when it makes sense.
