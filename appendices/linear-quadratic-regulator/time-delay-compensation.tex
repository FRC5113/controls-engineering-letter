\section{Time delay compensation}
\index{controller design!linear-quadratic regulator!time delay compensation}

Linear-Quadratic regulator controller gains tend to be aggressive, and in the
presence of sensor delay, they may be unstable (see figure
\ref{fig:elevator_time_delay_no_comp}). However, if we know the amount of delay,
we can design the controller for a projected version of the undelayed model.
That is, we can compute the control based on where the system will be after the
time delay (see figure \ref{fig:elevator_time_delay_comp}).

This method of delay compensation seems to work best for second-order systems.
Figure \ref{fig:drivetrain_time_delay_no_comp} shows time delay for a drivetrain
velocity system. Figure \ref{fig:drivetrain_time_delay_comp} shows that
compensating the controller gain significantly reduces the feedback gain. Mainly
feedforward is acting for a predominantly open-loop response, which has poor
disturbance rejection.

For this controller to be optimal, we need to have a time-varying control gain
to give the system an initial kick in the right direction. Since we are
effectively controlling the state some time in the future, the state
exponentially converges to zero and so does the control gain. However, the
inputs we use to project into the future start at zero since there's no history.
This is reflected by equation (10) in the original paper
\cite{bib:lqr_time_delay}. As the input buffer fills up, the controller gain
converges to the steady-state one we're using. Fixing the source of the time
delay is always preferred in general, but especially in cases that require a
constant controller gain.

We'll show how to derive this controller gain compensation for continuous and
discrete systems.

\subsection{Continuous case}

The continuous linear system is defined as
\begin{equation*}
  \dot{\mtx{x}} = \mtx{A}\mtx{x}(t) + \mtx{B}\mtx{u}(t)
\end{equation*}

Let the controller for this system be
\begin{equation*}
  \mtx{u}(t) = -\mtx{K}\mtx{x}(t)
\end{equation*}

Substitute this into the continuous model.
\begin{align*}
  \dot{\mtx{x}} &= \mtx{A}\mtx{x}(t) + \mtx{B}\mtx{u}(t) \\
  \dot{\mtx{x}} &= \mtx{A}\mtx{x}(t) + \mtx{B}(-\mtx{K}\mtx{x}(t)) \\
  \dot{\mtx{x}} &= \mtx{A}\mtx{x}(t) - \mtx{B}\mtx{K}\mtx{x}(t) \\
  \dot{\mtx{x}} &= (\mtx{A} - \mtx{B}\mtx{K}) \mtx{x}(t)
\end{align*}

Let $L$ be the amount of time delay in seconds. Take the matrix exponential from
the current time $t$ to $L$ in the future.
\begin{equation}
  \mtx{x}(t + L) = e^{(\mtx{A} - \mtx{B}\mtx{K})L} \mtx{x}(t)
    \label{eq:continuous_advance_state_by_delay}
\end{equation}

We can avoid the time delay if we compute the control based on the plant $L$
seconds in the future using equation
\eqref{eq:continuous_advance_state_by_delay}. Therefore, the latency-compensated
controller is
\begin{align}
  \mtx{u}(t) &= -\mtx{K}\mtx{x}(t + L) \nonumber \\
  \mtx{u}(t) &= -\mtx{K} e^{(\mtx{A} - \mtx{B}\mtx{K})L} \mtx{x}(t)
\end{align}

\subsection{Discrete case}

The discrete linear system is defined as
\begin{equation*}
  \mtx{x}_{k+1} = \mtx{A}\mtx{x}_k + \mtx{B}\mtx{u}_k
\end{equation*}

Let the controller for this system be
\begin{equation*}
  \mtx{u}_k = -\mtx{K}\mtx{x}_k
\end{equation*}

Substitute this into the discrete model.
\begin{align*}
  \mtx{x}_{k+1} &= \mtx{A}\mtx{x}_k + \mtx{B}\mtx{u}_k \\
  \mtx{x}_{k+1} &= \mtx{A}\mtx{x}_k + \mtx{B}(-\mtx{K}\mtx{x}_k) \\
  \mtx{x}_{k+1} &= \mtx{A}\mtx{x}_k - \mtx{B}\mtx{K}\mtx{x}_k \\
  \mtx{x}_{k+1} &= (\mtx{A} - \mtx{B}\mtx{K}) \mtx{x}_k
\end{align*}

Let $T$ be the duration between timesteps in seconds and $L$ be the amount of
time delay in seconds. $\frac{L}{T}$ gives the number of timesteps represented
by $L$.
\begin{equation}
  \mtx{x}_{k+L} = (\mtx{A} - \mtx{B}\mtx{K})^\frac{L}{T} \mtx{x}_k
    \label{eq:discrete_advance_state_by_delay}
\end{equation}

We can avoid the time delay if we compute the control based on the plant $L$
seconds in the future using equation \eqref{eq:discrete_advance_state_by_delay}.
Therefore, the latency-compensated controller is
\begin{align}
  \mtx{u}_k &= -\mtx{K}\mtx{x}_{k+L} \nonumber \\
  \mtx{u}_k &= -\mtx{K} (\mtx{A} - \mtx{B}\mtx{K})^\frac{L}{T} \mtx{x}_k
    \label{eq:discrete_delay_comp_control_law}
\end{align}

If the delay $L$ isn't a multiple of the sample period $T$ in equation
\eqref{eq:discrete_delay_comp_control_law}, we have to evaluate a fractional
matrix power, which can be tricky. If $\mtx{A} - \mtx{B}\mtx{K}$ is
diagonalizable, we can obtain an exact answer for
$(\mtx{A} - \mtx{B}\mtx{K})^\frac{L}{T}$ by decomposing
$\mtx{A} - \mtx{B}\mtx{K}$ into $\mtx{P}\mtx{D}\mtx{P}^{-1}$ where $\mtx{D}$ is
a diagonal matrix, computing $\mtx{D}^\frac{L}{T}$ as each diagonal element
raised to $\frac{L}{T}$, then recomposing
$\mtx{P}\mtx{D}^\frac{L}{T}\mtx{P}^{-1}$. If $\mtx{A} - \mtx{B}\mtx{K}$ isn't
diagonalizable, we'll have to approximate the matrix power by rounding
$\frac{L}{T}$ to the nearest integer. This approximation gets worse as
$L \bmod T$ approaches $\frac{T}{2}$.
