\chapter{Calculus}

This book uses derivatives and integrals occasionally to represent small changes
in values over small changes in time and the infintessimal sum of values over
time respectively. The formulas and tables presented here are all you'll need to
carry through with the math in later chapters.

If you are interested in more information after reading this chapter,
3Blue1Brown does a fantastic job of introducing them in his \textit{Essence of
calculus} video series \cite{bib:essence_of_calculus}. We recommend watching
videos 1 through 3 and 7 through 11 from that playlist for a solid foundation.
The Taylor series (presented in video 11) will be used in chapter
\ref{ch:digital_control}.
