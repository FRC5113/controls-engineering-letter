\section{Linear motion}

\begin{equation*}
  \sum F = ma
\end{equation*}

where $\sum F$ is the sum of all forces applied to an object in Newtons, $m$ is
the mass of the object in $kg$, and $a$ is the net acceleration of the object in
$\frac{m}{s^2}$.

\begin{equation*}
  x(t) = x_0 + v_0 t + \frac{1}{2}at^2
\end{equation*}

where $x(t)$ is an object's position at time $t$, $x_0$ is the initial position,
$v_0$ is the initial velocity, and $a$ is the acceleration.
