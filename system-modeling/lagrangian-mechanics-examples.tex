\chapter{Lagrangian mechanics examples}

A \gls{model} is a set of differential equations describing how the \gls{system}
behaves over time. There are two common approaches for developing them.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Collecting data on the physical system's behavior and performing
    \gls{system} identification with it.
  \item Using physics to derive the \gls{system}'s model from first principles.
\end{enumerate}

This chapter covers the second approach using Lagrangian mechanics.

We suggest reading \textit{An introduction to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
Mechanics} by Simon J.A. Malham for the basics
\cite{bib:an_intro_to_lagrangian_and_hamiltonian_mechanics}. Then, we'll apply
Lagrangian mechanics to FRC mechanisms in particular.

The \glspl{model} derived here should cover most types of motion seen on an FRC
robot. Furthermore, they can be easily tweaked to describe many types of
mechanisms just by pattern-matching. There's only so many ways to hook up a mass
to a motor in FRC. The flywheel \gls{model} can be used for spinning mechanisms,
the elevator \gls{model} can be used for spinning mechanisms transformed to
linear motion, and the single-jointed arm \gls{model} can be used for rotating
servo mechanisms (it's just the flywheel \gls{model} augmented with a position
\gls{state}).

These \glspl{model} assume all motor controllers driving DC brushed motors are
set to brake mode instead of coast mode. Brake mode behaves the same as coast
mode except where the applied voltage is zero. In brake mode, the motor leads
are shorted together to prevent movement. In coast mode, the motor leads are an
open circuit.
