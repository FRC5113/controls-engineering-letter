\chapter{Lagrangian mechanics examples}

A \gls{model} is a set of differential equations describing how the \gls{system}
behaves over time. There are two common approaches for developing them.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Collecting data on the physical system's behavior and performing
    \gls{system} identification with it.
  \item Using physics to derive the \gls{system}'s model from first principles.
\end{enumerate}

This chapter covers the second approach using Lagrangian mechanics.

We suggest reading \textit{An introduction to Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
Mechanics} by Simon J.A. Malham for the basics
\cite{bib:an_intro_to_lagrangian_and_hamiltonian_mechanics}.
