\chapter{Transfer functions}

This chapter briefly discusses what transfer functions are, how the locations of
poles and zeroes affect \gls{system response} and stability, and how controllers
affect pole locations. As long as you gain understanding of those concepts,
don't worry too much about not being able to follow the math presented here; we
won't use transfer functions in modern control theory (it's mainly provided for
completeness). This chapter is intended to provide a framework within which to
understand results from the mathematical machinery of modern control as well as
vocabulary to communicate that understanding.

\section{Laplace transform}

For an introduction to Laplace transforms and the geometric intuition behind
transfer functions, we recommend watching Zach Star's video ``What does the
Laplace Transform really tell us? A visual explanation (plus applications)" (21
minutes) \cite{bib:laplace_transform}. An optional, more mathematical
introduction is presented in appendix \ref{ch:laplace-domain-analysis} for
completeness.
