\section{Limitations}

PID's heuristic method of tuning is a reasonable choice when there is no
\textit{a priori} knowledge of the \gls{system} dynamics. However, controllers
with much better response can be developed if a \glslink{model}{dynamical model}
of the \gls{system} is known. Furthermore, PID only applies to single-input,
single-output (SISO) \glspl{system}; we'll cover methods for multiple-input,
multiple-output (MIMO) control in part \ref{part:modern_control_theory} of this
book.
