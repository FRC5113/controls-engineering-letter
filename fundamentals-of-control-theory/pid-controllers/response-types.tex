\section{Response types}

A \gls{system} driven by a PID controller generally has three types of
responses: underdamped, overdamped, and critically damped. These are shown in
figure \ref{fig:pid_responses}.

For the \glspl{step response} in figure \ref{fig:pid_responses}, \gls{rise time}
is the time the \gls{system} takes to initially reach the \gls{reference} after
applying the \gls{step input}. \Gls{settling time} is the time the \gls{system}
takes to settle at the \gls{reference} after the \gls{step input} is applied.

An \textit{underdamped} response oscillates around the \gls{reference} before
settling. An \textit{overdamped} response is slow to rise and does not overshoot
the \gls{reference}. A \textit{critically damped} response has the shortest
\gls{rise time} without oscillating around the \gls{reference} (i.e.,
overshooting then undershooting).
