\chapter{PID controllers}
\index{PID control}

The PID controller is a commonly used feedback controller consisting of
proportional, integral, and derivative terms, hence the name. This chapter will
build up the definition of a PID controller term by term while trying to provide
intuition for how each of them behaves.

First, we'll get some nomenclature for PID controllers out of the way. The
\gls{reference} is called the \gls{setpoint} (the desired position) and the
\gls{output} is called the \gls{process variable} (the measured position). Below
are some common variable naming conventions for relevant quantities.
\begin{figurekey}
  \begin{tabular}{llll}
    $r(t)$ & \gls{setpoint} & $u(t)$ & \gls{control input} \\
    $e(t)$ & \gls{error} & $y(t)$ & \gls{output}
  \end{tabular}
\end{figurekey}

The \gls{error} $e(t)$ is $r(t) - y(t)$.

For those already familiar with PID control, this book's interpretation won't be
consistent with the classical intuition of ``past", ``present", and ``future"
error. We will be approaching it from the viewpoint of modern control theory
with proportional controllers applied to different physical quantities we care
about. This will provide a more complete explanation of the derivative term's
behavior for constant and moving \glspl{setpoint}, and this intuition will carry
over to the modern control methods covered later in this book.

The proportional term drives the position error to zero, the derivative term
drives the velocity error to zero, and the integral term accumulates the area
between the \gls{setpoint} and \gls{output} plots over time (the integral of
position \gls{error}) and adds the current total to the \gls{control input}.
We'll go into more detail on each of these.
