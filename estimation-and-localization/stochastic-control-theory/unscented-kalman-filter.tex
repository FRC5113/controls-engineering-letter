In this book, we have covered the Kalman filter, which is the optimal unbiased
estimator for linear \glspl{system}. It isn't optimal for nonlinear
\glspl{system}, but several extensions to it have been developed to make it more
accurate.

The unscented Kalman filter propagates carefully chosen points called sigma
points through the nonlinear model to obtain an estimate of the true covariance
(as opposed to a linearized version of it). We recommend reading Roger Labbe's
book \textit{Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python} for more on unscented Kalman
filters\footnote{\url{https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python/blob/master/10-Unscented-Kalman-Filter.ipynb}}.

The original paper on the unscented Kalman filter is also an option
\cite{bib:unscented_kalman_filter}. The equations for van der Merwe's sigma
point algorithm are in \cite{bib:unscented_kalman_filter_2}. Here's a paper on a
quaternion-based Unscented Kalman filter for orientation tracking
\cite{bib:ukf_state_tracking}.
