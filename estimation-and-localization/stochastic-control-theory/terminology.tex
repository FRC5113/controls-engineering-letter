\section{Terminology}

First, we should provide definitions for terms that have specific meanings in
this field.

A causal system is one that uses only past information. A noncausal system also
uses information from the future. A filter is a causal system that
\textit{filters} information through a probabilistic model to produce an
estimate of a desired quantity that can't be measured directly. A smoother is a
noncausal system, so it uses information from before and after the current state
to produce a better estimate.
