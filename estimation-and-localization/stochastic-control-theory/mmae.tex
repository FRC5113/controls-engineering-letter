\section{Multiple model adaptive estimation}
\index{State-space observers!Multiple model adaptive estimation}

Multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) runs multiple Kalman filters with
different \glspl{model} on the same data. The Kalman filter with the lowest
residual has the highest likelihood of accurately reflecting reality. This can
be used to detect certain \gls{system} \glspl{state} like an aircraft engine
failing without needing to invest in costly sensors to determine this directly.

For example, say you have three Kalman filters: one for turning left, one for
turning right, and one for going straight. If the \gls{control input} is
attempting to fly the plane straight and the Kalman filter for going left has
the lowest residual, the aircraft's left engine probably failed.

See Roger Labbe's book \textit{Kalman and Bayesian Filters in Python} for more
on MMAE\footnote{MMAE section of
