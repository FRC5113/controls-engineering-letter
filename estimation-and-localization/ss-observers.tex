\chapter{State-space observers}

State-space \glspl{observer} are used to estimate \glspl{state} which cannot be
measured directly. This can be due to noisy measurements or the \gls{state} not
being measurable (a hidden \gls{state}). This information can be used for
\gls{localization}, which is the process of using external measurements to
determine an \gls{agent}'s pose\footnote{An agent is a system-agnostic term for
independent controlled actors like robots or aircraft.}, or orientation in the
world.

One type of \gls{state} estimator is LQE. ``LQE" stands for ``Linear-Quadratic
Estimator". Similar to LQR, it places the estimator poles such that it minimizes
the sum of squares of the estimation \gls{error}. The Luenberger \gls{observer}
and Kalman filter are examples of these, where the latter chooses the pole
locations optimally based on the \gls{model} and measurement uncertainties.

Computer vision can also be used for \gls{localization}. By extracting features
from an image taken by the \gls{agent}'s camera, like a retroreflective target
in FRC, and comparing them to known dimensions, one can determine where the
\gls{agent}'s camera would have to be to see that image. This can be used to
correct our \gls{state} estimate in the same way we do with an encoder or
gyroscope.
