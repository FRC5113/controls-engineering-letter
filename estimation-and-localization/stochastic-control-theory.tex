\chapter{Stochastic control theory}
\label{ch:stochastic_control_theory}

Stochastic control theory is a subfield of control theory that deals with the
existence of uncertainty either in observations or in the noise that drives the
evolution of a \gls{system}. We assign probability distributions to this random
noise and aim to achieve a desired control task despite the presence of this
noise.

Stochastic optimal control is concerned with doing this with minimum cost
defined by some cost functional, like we did with LQR earlier. First, we'll
cover the basics of probability and how we represent linear stochastic
\glspl{system} in state-space representation. Then, we'll derive an optimal
estimator using this knowledge, the Kalman filter, and demonstrate creative
applications of the Kalman filter theory.
