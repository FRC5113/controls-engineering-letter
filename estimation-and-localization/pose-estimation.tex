\chapter{Pose estimation}
\label{ch:pose_estimation}

Pose is a term for the orientation of an \gls{agent} (a system with a
controller). The plant usually includes the pose in its state vector. We'll
cover several methods for estimating an agent's pose from local measurements
such as encoders and gyroscope heading.
