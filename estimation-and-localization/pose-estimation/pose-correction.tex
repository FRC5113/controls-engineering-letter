\section{Pose correction}

The previous methods for pose estimation have assumed no direct pose
measurements are available. At best, only heading is available. To augment any
of them with corrections from full pose measurements, an Extended Kalman filter
(section \ref{sec:ekf}) or Unscented Kalman filter (section \ref{sec:ukf}) can
be used.
